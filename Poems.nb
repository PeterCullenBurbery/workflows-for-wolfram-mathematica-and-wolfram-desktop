weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore-- While I \
nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of some one gently \
rapping--rapping at my chamber door. \\\"'Tis some visitor,\\\" I muttered, \
\\\"tapping at my chamber door-- Only this and nothing more.\\\" Ah, \
distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December, And each separate dying \
ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. Eagerly I wished the morrow;--vainly \
I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost \
Lenore-- For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore-- \
Nameless here for evermore. And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each \
purple curtain Thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt \
before; So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating \
\\\"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door-- Some late \
visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;-- This it is and nothing \
more.\\\" Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, \
\\\"Sir,\\\" said I, \\\"or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; But the \
fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, And so faintly you \
came tapping--tapping at my chamber door, That I scarce was sure I heard \
you\\\"--here I opened wide the door:-- Darkness there and nothing more. Deep \
into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, Doubting, \
dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before; But the silence was \
unbroken, and the darkness gave no token, And the only word there spoken was \
the whispered word, \\\"Lenore!\\\" This I whispered, and an echo murmured \
back the word, \\\"Lenore!\\\" Merely this and nothing more. Back into the \
chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, Soon I heard again a tapping, \
somewhat louder than before. \\\"Surely,\\\" said I, \\\"surely that is \
something at my window lattice; Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this \
mystery explore-- Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore;-- \
'Tis the wind and nothing more.\\\" Open here I flung the shutter, when, with \
many a flirt and flutter, In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly \
days of yore; Not the least obeisance made he: not an instant stopped or \
stayed he; But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door-- \
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door-- Perched, and sat, \
and nothing more. Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, \
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore, \\\"Though thy \
crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\\\" I said, \\\"art sure no craven, Ghastly \
grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore-- Tell me what thy \
lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!\\\" Quoth the Raven, \
\\\"Nevermore.\\\" Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so \
plainly, Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore; For we \
cannot help agreeing that no living human being Ever yet was blessed with \
seeing bird above his chamber door-- Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust \
above his chamber door, With such name as \\\"Nevermore.\\\" But the Raven, \
sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only That one word, as if his soul \
in that one word he did outpour. Nothing further then he uttered--not a \
feather then he fluttered-- Till I scarcely more than muttered, \\\"Other \
friends have flown before-- On the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my hopes \
have flown before.\\\" Then the bird said, \\\"Nevermore.\\\" Startled at the \
stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken, \\\"Doubtless,\\\" said I, \
\\\"what it utters is its only stock and store, Caught from some unhappy \
master whom unmerciful Disaster Followed fast and followed faster till his \
songs one burden bore-- Till the dirges of his Hope the melancholy burden \
bore Of 'Never--nevermore.'\\\" But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul \
into smiling, Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust \
and door; Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking Fancy \
unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore-- What this grim, \
ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore Meant in croaking \
\\\"Nevermore.\\\" This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing \
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core; This and more I \
sat divining, with my head at ease reclining On the cushion's velvet lining \
that the lamp-light gloated o'er, But whose velvet violet lining with the \
lamp-light gloating o'er, She shall press, ah, nevermore! Then, methought, \
the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer Swung by Seraphim whose \
foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor. \\\"Wretch,\\\" I cried, \\\"thy God \
hath lent thee--by these angels he hath sent thee Respite--respite aad \
nepenth\[CapitalATilde]\[Copyright] from thy memories of Lenore! Quaff, oh \
quaff this kind nepenth\[CapitalATilde]\[Copyright], and forget this lost \
Lenore!\\\" Quoth the Raven, \\\"Nevermore.\\\" \\\"Prophet!\\\" said I, \
\\\"thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!-- Whether Tempter sent, \
or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore, Desolate yet all undaunted, on \
this desert land enchanted-- On this home by Horror haunted--tell me truly, I \
implore-- Is there--_is_ there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me, I \
implore!\\\" Quoth the Raven, \\\"Nevermore.\\\" \\\"Prophet!\\\" said I, \
\\\"thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil! By that Heaven that \
bends above us--by that God we both adore-- Tell this soul with sorrow laden \
if, within the distant Aidenn, It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the \
angels name Lenore-- Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name \
Lenore.\\\" Quoth the Raven, \\\"Nevermore.\\\" \\\"Be that word our sign of \
parting, bird or fiend!\\\" I shrieked, upstarting-- \\\"Get thee back into \
the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore! Leave no black plume as a token \
of that lie thy soul hath spoken! Leave my loneliness unbroken!--quit the \
bust above my door! Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from \
off my door!\\\" Quoth the Raven, \\\"Nevermore.\\\" And the Raven, never \
flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting On the pallid bust of Pallas \
just above my chamber door; And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's \
that is dreaming, And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on \
the floor; And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor \
Shall be lifted--nevermore!\"\>"], "Output",ExpressionUUID->"8797f0bb-02d9-\
